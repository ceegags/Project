Hey Paul. This is just a document to help you with your testing.
This can all be done on a real phone, and actually seems to not work on the emulator.

Here's a few steps to help you change your location while testing.

1. In the Android Developer Options, enable the "Allow Mock Locations" option.

2. Next, install an app that allows you to mock your location. The one that I used is here:

3. You can then select a place to fake your current location, and see that change reflected in our app.
